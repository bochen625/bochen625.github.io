			<div class="content-noSpaced">
				<h2 class="iga">Framing the Problem</h2>
				<p>The Independent Grocer Alliance (IGA) are family owned grocery stores that offer a tailored and local shopping experience. With a focus of providing for their local communities through brick and mortar stores, IGA is falling behind in digital sales in a growing competitive market.</p>

				<p>Rather than strengthening their online shopping experience, we focused on <span class="bold">designing for future senior customers</span> as IGA risks losing this customer segment when they can no longer shop or cook for themselves. We asked ourselves <span class="bold">how might we make healthy meal options more accessible</span> for senior IGA shoppers?</p>

		<!-- Research -->
		<section id="research">
			<div class="content-noSpaced">
				<h2 class="iga">Seniors in the United States</h2>
				<p>To better understand the current issues faced by seniors today, we conducted secondary research and discovered that the United States is one of only two developed countries in the world without a social insurance program for long-term care. As the eldery population continues to grow in the U.S., they will need more support in their day to day activities.</p>

				<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>By 2030, 1 out of every 5 U.S. citizens will be of retirement age.</li>
					<li>43% of the elderly in the U.S. are considered “high-need”.</li>
					<li>Approximately 80% of older adults have at least one chronic illnesses, and 77% have at least two.</li>
					<li>Malnutrition is a barrier to treating chronic illnesses.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="content">
				<h2 class="iga">Speculating Future Senior Needs</h2>
				<p>Through further secondary research, we found 4 key characteristics of future seniors. Based on our findings, we focused on IGA’s operations in the U.S. as we saw an <span class="bold">opportunity</span> to better equip IGA to become a leader in meeting seniors’ nutritional needs by positively impacting elderly customers’ quality of life.</p>

				<h3>4 Characteristics of Seniors</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><div class="bold">1. Quality of life</div></li>
					<li>Seniors value their independence and ability to stay at home during their retirement years.</li>
					<li><div class="bold">2. Digital intervention</div></li>
					<li>Gen X’s have learned to adopt technology in everyday life.</li>
					<li><div class="bold">3. Simplification</div></li>
					<li>Future seniors desire to simplify their lives in their retirement years.</li>
					<li><div class="bold">4. Living alone</div></li>
					<li>More seniors (65+) will be living alone during their retirement</li>
				</ul>

		<!--Process-->
		<section class="content-with-bg" id="process">
			<div class="content-noSpaced">
				<h2 class="iga">Design Sprint</h2>
				<p>To explore how we can make healthy meal options more accessible to seniors IGA shoppers, I co-led a 5 day virtual  design sprint which involved problem framing, understanding and defining our project goals, brainstorming, prototyping, and testing our intervention. Through the design sprint, we discovered that seniors use delivery services for their convenience. This led us to <span class="bold">explore and identify gaps in the current meal delivery services.</span></p>
			</div>

			<div class="content">
				<h2 class="iga">Persona and Journey Map</h2>
				<p>Synthesizing our insights, we developed our persona, Kashmir, a single retiree that was recently diagnosed with heart disease. She struggles to find healthy food options that are suitable for her needs and her arthritic pain prevents her from cooking.</p>

				<img src="img/iga-persona.png" alt="an image showing our persona, Kashmir">
				<p class="caption">The needs and goals of our demographic synthesized into a persona.</p>

				<p>Our persona informed our user journey map, where we identified two key areas to address and changed the questions we asked ourselves.</p>

				<h3>Key Areas to Address</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Difficulty in finding food suitable for one’s unique health needs</li>
					<li>Lack of personalization options in delivery services</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Revised How Might We's</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>How might we make meal delivery feel personalized for our senior audience in order to revive the joy of eating a home-cooked meal?</li>
					<li>How might we make meal options more accessible for seniors in order to help them regain a sense of independence?</li>
				</ol>
				<img src="img/iga-uj.png" alt="an image highlighting the two key areas to address">
				<p class="caption">The user journey of a traditional meal delivery service.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="content">
				<h2 class="iga">Prototyping and Refinement</h2>
				<p>In order to curate a menu based on the senior’s unique health needs, our first prototype asked for their health conditions and food preferences. Through user tests, we found that the preferences were well received by the seniors, but <span class="bold">some chronic illnesses were missing.</span></p>

				<p>Taking these findings, we asked ourselves how can we cover a range of chronic illnesses without overloading the seniors? Through interviews with dietitians and more secondary research, we found that seniors know what food to adopt and avoid. For the revised prototype, we focused the questions to ask about the types of diet they should follow instead of the type of conditions they have. This allowed us to cover a wide range of chronic illnesses, while <span class="bold">keeping their health conditions confidential.</span></p>

				<h2 class="iga">Accessibility Considerations</h2>
				<p>In our first iteration, I worked with two teammates to create low fidelity wireframes. To better understand how to design for this demographic, I looked at best practices around accessibility and synthesized my findings into a document, which helped inform our design decisions.</p>

				<h3>Key considerations</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Made with Love was designed for tablets as it is the most used device for seniors.</li>
					<li>Interactions on each screen were kept to a minimum to reduce cognitive overload.</li>
					<li>To reduce strains on the wrist, arrows were added as an option to assist with scrolling.</li>
					<li>A progress bar is used to keep the seniors situated in the process.</li>

				<h2 class="iga">Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project allowed me to better <span class="bold">empathize for the person I am designing for</span>, to be speculative by observing trends and making inferences about the future and anticipating, and projecting it into future needs. It also allowed me to look beyond the industry and identify gaps.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, as this is my first remote course, this experience has taught me that being <span class="bold">transparent</span> is important in allowing me to better empathize with my teammates and support them and this leads to more trust and efficient collaborations.</p>
