				<h2 class="rbc">Framing the Problem</h2>
				<p>Young adults play an important role in raising awareness about environmental issues. They believe they have the ability to make a difference, but lack the support and motivation to do so.</p>

				<p>Instead of trying to create something that young adults can do without a second thought, I asked my team <span class="bold">how might we make information on sustainability more accessible for young credit card owners in order to better equip them to make environmentally conscious decisions?</span></p>

				<p>Looking at learning methods and companies with loyalty programs and looking at educational material, I conducted a precedent study to <span class="bold">understand how loyalty programs are used to engage consumers, and to gain a better understanding of the various ways people learn and retain information.</span> From my findings, I generated a list of ideas that focused on guidance, learning, and positive reinforcement and presented it to my teammates.</p>

				<h2 class="rbc">Ideation, wireframe, and communication</h2>
				<p>As a team, we grouped and combined ideas together to form our solution. After, I quickly sketched out potential layouts of the solution and generated a set of 20+ wireframes. As the hacking phase was only 36 hours long, my team and I worked simultaneously together to ensure the idea was submitted by the deadline. A <span class="bold">challenge</span> occurred during the wireframing stage, where the developers were unsure of the flow of interactions presented in my sketches. Understanding that these developers have a different background than I do, I used a combination of wireframes and flowcharts to communicate how and where the user would click to proceed to the next screen.</p>

				<p>From our research, we found that RBC has at least 3 different apps in the app store. This led us to create an <span class="bold">extension of the app in order to reduce the amount of apps that users have to download.</span> As it would be an extension of the app, I referenced the current RBC Rewards App while sketching, wireframing, and creating mockups to ensure this added feature is consistent with the rest of the app.</p>

					<h2 class="rbc">Reflection</h2>
					<p>The idea was presented to 4+ RBC judges and awarded 1st place out of 15 teams. I am used to working with a group of designers, so this experience allowed me to work in a cross-disciplinary team. <span class="bold">Working with a cross-disciplinary team</span> taught me how to better empathize with my teammates who are not designers, to understand how our process and roles are interconnected, and it allowed me to form a deeper sense of appreciation and communication with my team. I am extremely proud of my team and how fluidly we worked together and took ownership of our roles in this short time. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="content">
					<p><span class="bold">Going forward</span>, if I had more time to work on this, I would perform user tests with current RBC Reward members to see if this is something they would use and how to improve it. I would also add different types of learning methods, such as a mini-game where one would have to sort out recycling, compost, and garbage in the correct bin, and perform an A/B test to see which types of learning methods are preferred.</p>
